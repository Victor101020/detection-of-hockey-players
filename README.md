# detection-of-hockey-players
A project to find hockey players in photos or videos to create a recommendation training system

Within the framework of this project, a system is being developed that can give recommendations to hockey coaches to identify permanent errors in the athlete's game. At the moment, coaches have to process a large pool of video recordings to identify a player's problem, our task is to solve this problem.
